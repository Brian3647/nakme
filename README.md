# nakme

_simple, fast & secure project sharing platform_

## what?

nakme is a platform created for sharing projects with others, giving & receiving feedback and finding collaborators.

## why?

unless it's something very, very big, normally it's hard to find people to work with you on your OSS projects. When multiple people collaborate on the same thing, programming becomes more fun, faster and more efficient. This app is not meant to be a repository hosting service, but rather a sharing platform.

## how?

the backend is built with [go](https://golang.org/) (specifically [echo](https://echo.labstack.com/)). The frontend is yet to be started, but it will probably be build with something very simple like [vue](https://vuejs.org/).
