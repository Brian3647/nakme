# contributing guidelines üçª

contributions are welcome! to make it easier, the guidelines have been severely simplified. If you have any questions, feel free to open an issue.

## code style

- use gofmt
- use [.editorconfig](https://editorconfig.org/) (if your editor supports it)

## commit messages

even though optional, it's recommended to use either (https://www.conventionalcommits.org/en/v1.0.0/), [gitmoji](https://gitmoji.carloscuesta.me/) or [cm](https://github.com/Brian3647/cm).

## issues

- try to follow the issue template, but if you can't, that's fine
- be descriptive
- don't open multiple issues for the same thing (will be closed as duplicates)

## pull requests

moslty the same rules as issues, but also:

- try to make small commits so that they're easier to review
- if possible, document your process in the PR description/comments
